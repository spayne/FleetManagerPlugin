## FleetManagerPlugin
This plugin contains common fleet management functionality used by the specific fleet plugins (e.g. the Game LiftStarter plugin).

Refer to [GameLiftStarterPlugin](https://github.com/spayne/GameLiftStarterPlugin) for a step by step guide to deploying one of the backends.  Note that the GameLiftStarterPlugin is the first of a series of backend plugins: More can be added to support different backends and designs.

The modules include:
* FleetManagerModule - that communicates the the specific fleet backend
* FleetManagerEditor - that provides the Menu hooks; Slate Tab Manager GUI and custom Widgets.
